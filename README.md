Learning about React Portals

## Portals
Worked to build a Modal, and use React Portal to allow this Modal to breakout of the DOM heirarchy tree. 

## DOM Manipulation
You never want to, or rarely should, manipulate the dom directly. React does that for us. However there are some cases where you may need to do so. 
Working with useRefs, in order to reset an input value, I manually manipulated the dom.
